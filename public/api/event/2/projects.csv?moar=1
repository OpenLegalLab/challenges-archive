[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/oldp.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/oldp)

OLDP is a web application, written in Python 3.5 and based on the [Django web framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/),
It is used for processing legal text and providing a REST-API and Elasticsearch-based search engine.
OLDP is being develop by the non-profit initiative [Open Legal Data](https://openlegaldata.io/) with the goal
of building an Open Data platform for legal documents (mainly court decisions and laws).
The platform makes legal information freely accessible for the general public and especially third-party apps.

Our documentation is available [here](https://oldp.readthedocs.io/).

## Demo

[![Live demo](https://github.com/openlegaldata/oldp/raw/master/docs/_static/screenshot.sm.png)](https://github.com/openlegaldata/oldp/raw/master/docs/_static/screenshot.png)

A live demo is available [here](https://de.openlegaldata.io/) (in German).

## Features

- **Cases**: Court decisions with meta data and content in HTML.
- **Laws**: Full-text laws and regulations and their corresponding case-law.
- **Courts**: Browse courts organized by states, jurisdiction and level of appeal from your country.
- **Search**: A document search engine based on Elasticsearch/Haystack supporting most common search syntax and faceting.
- **API**: Adding, updating, retrieving and deleting data through CRUD REST API based on [DRF](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) including
    auto-generated API clients from Swagger.
- **Themes**: Easily adjust the look and feel depending on your countries needs (see [German theme](https://github.com/openlegaldata/oldp-de)).

## Installation guide

Before you can use OLDP, you’ll need to get it installed.
For a more detailed guide on how to get started with OLDP have a look at:
[Getting started](https://oldp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html)

### Docker

To skip the whole installation procedure you can simply run OLDP as Docker container.
Just `git clone` the repository first and then start everything with a `docker-compose up` from within the repository directory.
A small tutorial on how to use OLDP with Docker can be found [here](https://oldp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docker.html).

### Dependencies

Before anything else you will need to install the application dependencies.

- **Python 3.5** with pip (virtualenv or conda recommended)
- **Node JS 8.12.x** with npm for building JS dependencies
- **Database (MySQL, SQLite, ...):** All database engines that support
  [Django's DB API](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/databases/) should work. MySQL is recommended.
- **Elasticsearch 5.4.x**: Our search engine backend. Other systems supported by [haystack](http://haystacksearch.org/)
  should also work.
- **Redis 4.x**: Caching engine (optional)
- **gcc** Required to compile some Python libs
- **python-mysqldb, libmysqlclient-dev** if you choose MySQL as database
- **gettext** for Django locales with msguniq
- **pandoc** convert docbook to HTML (import GG)
- **GDAL**: Geospatial libraries used by the haystack search module (see
  [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/contrib/gis/install/geolibs/)).

```
# Create virtualenv
virtualenv -p python3 env
source env/bin/activate

# Clone repository to current directory
git clone https://github.com/openlegaldata/oldp.git .

# Install dependencies
apt-get install -y $(cat apt_requirements.txt)
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
```

The first time you run OLDP, you will need to initialize the database with its default blank values. If you want
to run OLDP in production mode, you also need to prepare static files and localization.

```
# Prepare assets (JS, CSS, images, fonts, ...)
npm run-script build

# Prepare database
./manage.py migrate

# Localization (German and English, needed for production)
./manage.py compilemessages --l de --l en

# Prepare static files (needed for production)
./manage.py collectstatic --no-input

```

## Run

Run the following command to start the web app at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).

```
./manage.py runserver 8000
```

### Settings

The manage the app settings we rely on [django-configurations](https://django-configurations.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
Pre-configured settings can be used by setting the `DJANGO_CONFIGURATION` environment variable to either `Prod`, `Dev` or `Test`.
You can as well override specific settings from `oldp/settings.py` with environment variables:

| Variable name | Default value | Comment |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` | `oldp.settings` | Tell  Django which settings file you want to use (in Python path syntax). |
| `DJANGO_CONFIGURATION` | `Prod` | Choice a predefined class of settings: `Dev`, `Prod` or `Test` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `mysql://oldp:oldp@127.0.0.1/oldp` | Path to database (usually mysql or sqlite) |
| `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` | `None` | Set this to a secret value in production mode |
| `DJANGO_ELASTICSEARCH_URL` | `http://localhost:9200/` | Elasticsearch settings (scheme, host, port) |
| `DJANGO_ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX` | `oldp` | Elasticsearch index name |
| `DJANGO_DEBUG` | `True` | Enable to show debugging messages and errors |
| `DJANGO_ADMINS` | `Admin,admin@openlegaldata.io` | Format: `Foo,foo@site.com;Bar,bar@site.com` |
| `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | `None` | Format: `foo.com,bar.net` |
| `DJANGO_LANGUAGES_DOMAINS` | | Format: `{'de.foo.com':'de','fr.foo.com':'fr'}` |
| `DJANGO_DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` | `no-reply@openlegaldata.io` | Emails are sent from this address |
| `DJANGO_EMAIL_HOST` | `localhost` | SMTP server |
| `DJANGO_EMAIL_HOST_USER` | | SMTP user |
| `DJANGO_EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` | | SMTP password |

","At OLL 2022 we proposed the challenge to investigate, evaluate, discuss, and contribute to **efforts to improve interoperability** between platforms that collect and publish open legal data. Currently OLDP application only has data available from German courts. Documentation is available on [adding processing steps](https://oldp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development.html) for additional data sources. Further details of the application below. The project can be reached here: [@openlegaldata](https://twitter.com/openlegaldata)

While we did not manage to upload the data we wanted to, we investigated the process, and collected ideas of how to facilitate the process over time and involve the community. Generally we think having common standards for case data and other topics is very important, and we are aware of several initiatives like OLDP which aim to federate across repositories. Several hackathon projects did the legwork required, e.g.:

# Dataset of Legal Documents

Court decisions from 2017 and 2018 were selected for the dataset, published online by the [Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection](http://www.rechtsprechung-im-internet.de). The documents originate from seven federal courts: Federal Labour Court (BAG), Federal Fiscal Court (BFH), Federal Court of Justice (BGH), Federal Patent Court (BPatG), Federal Social Court (BSG), Federal Constitutional Court (BVerfG) and Federal Administrative Court (BVerwG). 

## [Annotation Guidelines](https://github.com/elenanereiss/Legal-Entity-Recognition/blob/master/docs/Annotationsrichtlinien.pdf) (German)

## Size

The dataset consists of 66,723 sentences with 2,157,048 tokens. The sizes of the seven court-specific datasets varies between 5,858 and 12,791 sentences, and 177,835 to 404,041 tokens. The distribution of annotations on a per-token basis corresponds to approx. 19-23 %.

# Dataset of Legal Documents

Court decisions from 2017 and 2018 were selected for the dataset, published online by the [Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection](http://www.rechtsprechung-im-internet.de). The documents originate from seven federal courts: Federal Labour Court (BAG), Federal Fiscal Court (BFH), Federal Court of Justice (BGH), Federal Patent Court (BPatG), Federal Social Court (BSG), Federal Constitutional Court (BVerfG) and Federal Administrative Court (BVerwG). 

## [Annotation Guidelines](https://github.com/elenanereiss/Legal-Entity-Recognition/blob/master/docs/Annotationsrichtlinien.pdf) (German)

## Size

The dataset consists of 66,723 sentences with 2,157,048 tokens. The sizes of the seven court-specific datasets varies between 5,858 and 12,791 sentences, and 177,835 to 404,041 tokens. The distribution of annotations on a per-token basis corresponds to approx. 19-23 %.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elenanereiss/Legal-Entity-Recognition/master/docs/Size.png)

## Distribution of Entities

The dataset includes two different versions of annotations, one with a set of 19 fine-grained semantic classes and another one with a set of 7 coarse-grained classes. There are 53,632 annotated entities in total, the majority of which (74.34 %) are legal entities, the others are person, location and organization (25.66 %).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elenanereiss/Legal-Entity-Recognition/master/docs/Distribution.png)

## Output Format

The dataset is freely available under the [CC-BY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en). The output format is CoNLL-2002. Each line consists of two columns separated by a space. The first column contains a token and the second a tag in IOB2 format. The sentence boundary is marked with an empty line.
